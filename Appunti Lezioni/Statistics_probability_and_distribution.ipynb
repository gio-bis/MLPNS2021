        "Descriptive statistics: when you have a set of number you can summarize its properties by looking at some specific characteristics of the distribution. Thet are the spread, the central tendency, the mean, standard deviation the skewness, kurtosis ... Descriptive statistics is always part of our analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "Don't use the mean to describe a distribution because it is subject to the presence of outlier in the distribution. You use the median instead of the mean to describe the central tendency of the distribution. The median is the place where 50 percent of numbers al larger and 50 percent of numbers are smaller.There is no method median associated to numpy. The mode is the most frequent value. If a distribution is symmetric the mean and the median are the same. The spread of distribution is generally measured as the variance or the standard deviation. The variance is the square of the standard deviation.\n",

When the mean is large it become symmetric and it is a Gaussian whit mean = lambda and standard deviation = sqrt(lambda). It is true also for the binomial distribution which can be approximated by gaussian in an appropriate regime.\n",

        "Assuming that I have a set of indipendent (there are no covariance between the variables that I selected from the sample) and identically distributed (they came from the same distribution) random variable, each sample will have the same mean and the same std. Then, when I take the mean of the sample is close to the mean of the population. The mean of the random sample is a random variable which is gaussian distributed with standard deviation and meand determined by the size of the sample. So, for N that grows to infinity the mean gets infinitely closer to the mean of the popultion.\n",

For the limit of the number of samples N that grows large, the average of the sample means (I take N samples, I take the mean of each of the samples and I take the average of those means. That one approcheas the mean of the population in a way that is gaussian distributes with mean 0 and std = sigma/sqrt(N). So not only I get closer to the mean of population but I can quantify how far I am statistically from the mean of population. Because "
